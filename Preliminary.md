1. Familiarize yourself with GitHub workflow
   * Walk through [workflow](#workflow) 
    
## Typical workflow
1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking] for the test project (found under [github.com/fdac21](https://github.com/fdac21))
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. View, create, and edit your files
1. [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository


Feedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with
your thoughts and questions!  You are welcome to open the pull
request as the work is still in-progress if you are stuck and want
to ask a question â€“ just mention `@audris` with the question to make
sure I know to look at it sooner.

## Initial setup: to be done on/by Aug 26 on


## Configuring ssh 
  * On linux/mac
     * create .ssh/config
    	1. create ~/.ssh/config
        ```
         host da2
            hostname da2.eecs.utk.edu
            port YOURPORT #from students/ports.md
            user YOURNETID
            LocalForward 8888 127.0.0.1:8888
            IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
            StrictHostKeyChecking no
            UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
         ```

        1. place your private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        1. Make sure permissions are right
         ```
          chmod -R og-rwx ~/.ssh
         ```
        1. ssh da2
    * Or ssh directly 
      ```
       ssh -pYOURPORT -L8888:localhost:8888 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa yournetid@da2.eecs.utk.edu
      ```
  * Windows 10 has ubuntu subsystem: use that please
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview


  * Putty is an ssh client for earlier versions of windows, please avoid if you have Win10 or later
  * [Instructions on how to generate ssh key running windows](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows) 

       1. How to generate key via putty
       1. ![generate the key via puttygen](https://github.com/fdac21/news/blob/master/PuttyGen.png "generate new key puttygen")

       1. ![public ssh key from puttygen](https://github.com/fdac21/news/blob/master/puttykey.png "public ssh key from puttygen")

       1. Save the private key and use it in your putty ssh session
       1. Copy the public key (highlited in the image) to add to the yournetid.key
